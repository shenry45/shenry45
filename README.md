# Full Stack Engineer

In the beginning I thought of Github as a place for the masterful, the elite, to change the world as we know it. Their ideas and hard work were a large inspiration to model myself after. Now I join them with my talents for the better. [My work can be found here.](http://shawnphenry.com/)

Taking my coding experience to the next step in 2019 I started my journey to designing modern PWAs using the latest technologies like React. The course that I attribute my programming knowledge from is [Lambda Schools](https://lambdaschool.com/) which is a bootcamp that focuses on teaching only the proven and market-adopted languages, also the libraries thereunder. During the over-one-year-long course there was many projects that required teamwork to achieve the MVP. A course project which had the relatively largest team and biggest roles I took on can be found in the pins below, Neighborhood Library.
